It's a fully responsive clone of Razorpay website using Tailwind CSS(framework) only.

I have build this clone from scratch:

1.getting started with installation part of tailwind css https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss
2.set-up for font, images, color variables in tailwind config file
3.learning tailwind while building the clone
4.making it responsive
